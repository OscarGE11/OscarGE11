# Ã“scar GarcÃ­a Espinosa - Web Developer

Hi there! I'm Ã“scar, a **Full Stack developer** based in Madrid, passionate about learning and growing in the world of web development. While I'm confident working on the backend, I especially enjoy building **frontend** apps. I like to improve my skills by working on personal projects and exploring new tools that help me become a better developer.
